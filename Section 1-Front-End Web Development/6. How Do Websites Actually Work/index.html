                    <p><strong class="bold">DNS Server;</strong>
                        can look up the IP address of any website you want to access. And when you find that address, you can directly hit up the server computer for the website that you want to view & they will send you all the files & data for your browser to be able to render it on screen.</p>
                    <p>Now, the data that you receive from that server usually consists of 3 types of files;
                        HTML, CSS, & JavaScript. They are so integral to how websites work.</p>
                    <p><strong>Code files;</strong>
                        HTML, CSS & JS</p>
                    <p><span class="key bold">HTML;</span>
                        responsible for the content in your website, like text content, images, buttons, links.</p>
                    <p><span class="key bold">CSS;</span>
                        responsible for styling your website, like color. Determines how your website will look, background color of the page, will the buttons have rounded corners?. It targets all the content in your website that you created using HTML, eg text, buttons & applies styling to those elements.</p>
                    <p><span class="key bold">JavaScript;</span>
                        code that allows your website to actually do things, or have functionality. It turns a static website which has pretty images or text into something that a user can actually interact with, eg send an email in Gmail, or post your breakfast on Instagram.</p>
                    <p>Combined together is how we create modern websites.</p>

                        <p>Google in 1998; you should really try this in Google, coz when you hit search, it'll turn Google into what it looked like in 1998.</p>
